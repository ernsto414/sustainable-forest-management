Technology aids forest management through advanced monitoring, data analysis, and planning tools like satellite imagery, drones, and AI. These tools help detect illegal logging, monitor forest health and deforestation, predict wildfires, manage resources sustainably, and even assist in reforestation efforts.  
Monitoring and surveillance
Satellite imagery and drones: Provide real-time data for monitoring forest health, deforestation, and illegal activities. They can also map forest ecosystems and biodiversity hotspots. 
LiDAR: This technology maps the 3D structure of forests, allowing for more accurate biomass estimates. 
Acoustic monitoring: Systems like Rainforest Connection use sound sensors to detect the noise of chainsaws, providing real-time alerts for illegal logging. 
Planning and analysis
GIS (Geographic Information Systems): Helps in spatial planning, conservation efforts, and making informed decisions based on collected data. 
Artificial intelligence (AI): Analyzes vast datasets from satellite imagery and sensors to identify patterns in forest health, biodiversity, and environmental conditions. AI can help predict wildfire risks and assess the impact of climate change. 
Resource management and conservation
Reforestation: Technology assists in selecting the best tree species for a location and monitoring the health of newly planted trees. 
Biodiversity tracking: Sensors and drones gather detailed information on species distribution and habitat conditions, which is used to create targeted conservation strategies. 
Data-driven decisions: By providing accurate and timely data, technology helps in sustainable resource management, from timber harvesting to protecting ecosystems, notes A Square Solutions.
